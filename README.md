Here’s a polished **description** you can include at the top of your GitHub project's README or in the GitHub description field:

> **A modern, responsive eCommerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — perfect for learning frontend design and layout structure.**

You can also use one of these alternatives, depending on your project's focus:

### For a learning/project showcase:

> A clean, responsive frontend eCommerce layout made for practicing modern web design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### For template reuse:

> Fully responsive eCommerce website template suitable for small businesses, product showcases, or frontend practice.

Would you like the description to focus more on learning, business use, or design showcase?
